Fluency Test
——————————
The experiment:

	In this task participants are required to either (1) type in as many words as possible for different categories that were previously shown to elicit different strategies OR (2) complete a phonemic fluency task in which they are given a letter of the alphabet and they are asked to come up with as many words as they can that start with that letter. Participants have 90 seconds to come up with as many items/words as possible for each trial. After typing the words they press enter. There are three Conditions (Spatial, Nonepisodic & Phonemic) and each condition has 3 categories. (9 trials in total)

Analysing your data:
	Data is stored in the excel file produced by PsychoPy in the data folder. The .csv file includes all the words participants typed, as well as the timestamps for when they pressed “Enter” from the beginning of the trial. 
	Total number of word recalled in one trial is the word column number + 1 (word columns start at 0) minus any non-words and/or empty spaces.
	The reaction time for each word is the timestamp for each word minus the timestamp for the previous word (e.g., rt_2 - rt_1 for the second word)
